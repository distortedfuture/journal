# journal

okkkkkkkk

this is a terminal based journal script.
I wanted to create a logging system inside my terminal that would let me read/write logs on command.
save this in a folder where you would like to save your journals. each journal you opn will create a dir with the chosen name; entries are saved as .txt files.
I got most of the main ideas from an article from medium.com (https://medium.com/thebit/intro-to-file-i-o-and-terminal-usage-how-to-create-a-journal-using-python-7bf1ccf1549a)
i added a lot of my own ideas using the OS and Shutil modules.
please use this as you please, add to it, or customize it to your liking.

Enjoy!!!!!
